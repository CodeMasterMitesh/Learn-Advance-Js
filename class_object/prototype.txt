In JavaScript, a prototype is an object that serves as a template from which other objects inherit properties and methods. 
Every object in JavaScript has a prototype, which is another object that it implicitly links to. 
This forms a prototype chain.


Key aspects of prototypes in JavaScript:
Inheritance:
Prototypes are the fundamental mechanism for inheritance in JavaScript. 
When you try to access a property or method on an object, JavaScript first looks for it directly on that object. 
If not found, it then looks up the prototype chain, checking the object's prototype, 
then its prototype's prototype, and so on, until it finds the property or reaches the end of the chain (which is typically null).

Sharing Properties and Methods:
Prototypes allow you to define properties and methods once on a prototype object, 
and then all objects that inherit from that prototype will automatically have access to those shared properties and methods without needing to duplicate them.
This promotes code reusability and efficiency.

prototype Property of Constructors:
Functions in JavaScript (which can also act as constructors for creating objects) have a special prototype property. 
This prototype property is the object that will serve as the prototype for all objects created using that constructor with the new keyword.
__proto__ Property:
While not recommended for direct manipulation in modern JavaScript, objects have an internal [[Prototype]] slot, often exposed as the __proto__ property, which points to their prototype object.
